He observed that the fixed air was denser than air and did not support either flame or animal life. Black also found that when bubbled through an aqueous solution of lime (calcium hydroxide), it would precipitate calcium carbonate.<sup>[1]</sup>'], ['pmain2', 'Scientists realized for the first time that there was more than one kind of air - that gases represented a whole new dimension of matter to be explored.<sup>[2]</sup>'], ['h2', 'Rediscovery Of The Elements:'], ['pmain2', 'In the 1700s, alkalies were known to include <span data-title=\'Potash was a\nsubstance used for bleaching textiles, making glass, and making soap.

Each of these\nalkalies could appear in "mild" (carbonate) and "caustic" (hydroxide) forms.<sup>[4]</sup>'], ['h2', 'Two Thousand Year Of Science:'], ['pmain2', 'One of Black\'s investigations was concerned with th nature of limestone. Obtain some limestone\nand put a small piece into a test-tube containing some water. Nothing happens; but add a few drops of "spirit of\nsalt" (hydrochloric acid), and at once bubbles are given off from the limestone, and this effervesence continues\nuntil all the limestone or acid had disappeared.'], ['pmain2', 'Take another piece of limestone and heat it to redness; it becomes after a time a porous solid,\nwhich no longer effervences with acid, but, on the other hand, if water is added, it swells and becomes hot.'], ['pmain2', "From these experiments we learn, first, that limestone is insoluble in pure water, but is acted\nupon by an acid with the loss of a gas, leaving something behind which is soluble in water. Second, we learn that\nheat alters the limestone in such a way that the substance left gives off no gas when treated with the acid. This\nsubstance is called quick lime. When water is added is added to quick lime, they form something called 'slaked\nlime'. Slaked lime is sparingly soluble in water producing an alkaline solution known as limewater."], ['pmain2', 'Joseph Black weighed some pieces of limestone and placed them in a flask, along with water, to\nwhich he added some acid, and by means of a tube, connected the flask with a reciever filled with water standing\nmouth downwards, over a trough full of water:'], ['displayimg2', 'limestone.png'], ['pmain2', 'The gas which was collected was found to be the same in nature and amount as that got by heating\nlimestone.'], ['pmain2', 'He next took some lime-water and bubbled the gas through it and obtained a white precipitate,\nwhich he proved to be identical with limestone. Since the gas was orginally "locked up" in the limestone, he\ncalled it "fixed air". By using a solution of litmus, a Swede, called Bergman, showed that "fixed air" was an\nacid, and in 1779, the French chemist, Laviosier, proved that "fixed air" was a compound of carbon and oxygen,\nand renamed it carbonic acid.'], ['source_format', ['<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Black" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Black</a>', '<a href="http://www.mysteryofmatter.net/Priestley.html" target="_blank">http://www.mysteryofmatter.net/Priestley.html</a>', '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potash" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potash</a>', '<a href="https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc501453/m2/1/high_res_d/metadc501453.pdf" target="_blank">Rediscovery of the Elements</a>', '<cite className="Two Thousand Years of science, The Birth Time Of Science"></cite>', '<a href="https://www.sciencelearn.org.nz/resources/474-lime-a-time-tested-chemical" target="_blank">https://www.sciencelearn.org.nz/resources/474-lime-a-time-tested-chemical</a>', '<a href="https://books.google.ca/books/about/Experiments_Upon_Magnesia_Alba_Quick_lim.html?id=bUVPtQ_uixEC&amp;redir_esc=y" target="_blank">Experiments Upon Magnesuim Alba, Quick-Lime And Other Alcaline Substances (not used)</a>']]];
