Mead, or honey wine, was produced in\nAsia during the Vedic period (around 1700-1100 BC), and the Greeks, Celts, Saxons, and Vikings also produced\nthis beverage.'], ['pmain2', 'At the time, people knew that leaving fruits and grains in covered containers for a long\ntime produced wine and beer, but no one fully understood why the recipe worked. The process was named\nfermentation, from the Latin word fervere, which means "to boil." The name came from the observation that\nmixtures of crushed grapes kept in large vessels produced bubbles, as though they were boiling. Producing\nfermented beverages was tricky. If the mixture did not stand long enough, the product contained no alcohol;\nbut if left for too long, the mixture rotted and was undrinkable. Through empirical observation, people\nlearned that temperature and air exposure are key to the fermentation process.'], ['pmain2', 'People across the world have enjoyed fermented foods and beverages like beer, wine, bread,\nyogurt, cheese, and pickled vegetables for all of recorded history. Discoveries from several archeological\nsites suggest that even prehistoric people took advantage of fermentation to preserve and enhance the taste\nof food. Archaeologists studying pottery jars from a Neolithic village in China found that people were making\na fermented beverage from rice, honey, and fruit as early as 7000 BC.'], ['pmain2', 'While it is likely that people first learned about fermentation by accident—perhaps by drinking old milk that\nhad curdled or old grape juice that had fermented—they later learned to harness the power of fermentation to\nmake products like bread, cheese, and wine.'], ['source_format', ['<a href="https://openstax.org/details/books/microbiology" target="_blank">https://openstax.org/details/books/microbiology</a>', '<a href="https://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/yeast-fermentation-and-the-making-of-beer-14372813/" target="_blank">https://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/yeast-fermentation-and-the-making-of-beer-14372813/</a>']]];
