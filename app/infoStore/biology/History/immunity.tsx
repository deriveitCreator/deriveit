While many believed that illness was punishment for\nangering the gods or was simply the result of fate, archaeological evidence suggests that prehistoric people\nattempted to treat illnesses and infections.'], ['pmain2', 'Several ancient civilizations appear to have had some understanding that disease could be\ntransmitted by things they could not see. This is especially evident in historical attempts to contain the\nspread of disease.'], ['pmain2', 'The ancient Greeks attributed disease to bad air, mal\'aria, which they called "miasmatic\nodors." They developed hygiene practices that built on this idea. The Romans also believed in the miasma\nhypothesis and created a complex sanitation infrastructure to deal with sewage.'], ['pmain2', 'The Greek philosopher and historian Thucydides (460 - 395 BC) is considered the father of\nscientific history because he advocated for evidence-based analysis of cause-and-effect reasoning. Among his\nmost important contributions are his observations regarding the Athenian plague that killed one-third of the\npopulation of Athens between 430 and 410 BC. Having survived the epidemic himself, Thucydides made the\nimportant observation that survivors did not get re-infected with the disease, even when taking care of\nactively sick people. This observation shows an early understanding of the concept of immunity.'], ['pmain2', 'Even before the invention of the microscope, some doctors, philosophers, and scientists\nmade great strides in understanding the invisible forces (what we now know as microbes) that can cause\ninfection, disease, and death.'], ['h3', 'Hippocrates:'], ['pmain2', 'The Greek physician Hippocrates (460 - 370 BC) is considered the "father of\nWestern medicine" and was a pupil of Democritus (who proposed the idea of the atoms). Unlike many of his\nancestors and contemporaries, he dismissed the idea that disease was caused by supernatural forces. Instead,\nhe posited that diseases had natural causes from within patients or their environments.'], ['pmain2', "Hippocrates intorduced a new system of treatment; he began by making a careful study of the\npatient's body, and having diagnosed the complaint, set about curing it by giving directions to the sufferer\nas to his diet and the routine of his daily life, leaving nature largely to heal itself."], ['h3', 'Birth Of Microbiology:'], ['pmain2', 'Marcus Terentius Varro (116 - 27 BC) was a prolific Roman writer who was one of the first\npeople to propose the concept that things we cannot see (what we now call microorganisms) can cause disease.\nIn Res Rusticae (On Farming), published in 36 BC, he said that â€œprecautions must also be taken in\nneighborhood swamps... because certain minute creatures [animalia minuta] grow there which cannot be seen by\nthe eye, which float in the air and enter the body through the mouth and nose and there cause serious\ndiseases.'], ['pmain2', 'While the ancients may have suspected the existence of invisible "minute creatures," it\nwasn\'t until the invention of the microscope that their existence was definitively confirmed. While it is\nunclear who exactly invented the microscope, a Dutch cloth merchant named Antonie van Leeuwenhoek (1632 - 1723)\nwas the first to develop a lens powerful enough to view microbes. In 1675, using a simple but powerful\nmicroscope, Leeuwenhoek was able to observe single-celled organisms, which he described as "animalcules" or\n"wee little beasties," swimming in a dropof rain water.'], ['source_format', ['<a href="https://openstax.org/details/books/microbiology" target="_blank">https://openstax.org/details/books/microbiology</a>', '<a href="https://books.google.ca/books/about/Two_Thousand_Years_of_Science.html?id=qx57ngEACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y" target="_blank">Two Thousand Years Of Science: The Wonders Of Nature And Their Discoverers (by R.
