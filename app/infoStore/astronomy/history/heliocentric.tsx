For a traveler going from any place toward the north, that pole of the\ndaily rotation gradually climbs higher, while the opposite pole drops down an\nequal amount. More stars in the north are seen not to set, while in the south\ncertain stars are no longer seen to rise. Thus Italy does not see Canopus, which\nis visible in Egypt; and Italy does see the River's last star, which is unfamiliar to\nour area in the colder region. Such stars, conversely, move higher in the heavens\nfor a traveler heading southward, while those which are high in our sky sink\ndown. Meanwhile, moreover, the elevations of the poles have the same ratio\neverywhere to the portions of the earth that\nhave been traversed. This happens on no other figure than the sphere.

On the other hand, if a light is attached to the top of the mast, as the ship draws away from land, those who remain ashore see the light drop down gradually until it finally disappears, as though setting.\n'], ['pmain2', 'The motion of the heavenly bodies is uniform, eternal, and circular or compounded of circular motions:'], ['subText', 'The motion of the heavenly bodies is circular,\nsince the motion appropriate to a sphere is rotation in a circle. In connection with the numerous [celestial] spheres, however, there are many motions. The most conspicuous of all is the daily rotation, which the Greeks call <b>nuchthemeron</b>, that is, the interval of a day and a night. The entire universe, with the exception of the earth, is conceived as whirling from east to west in this rotation.\n'], ['subText', '\n\tSecondly, we see other revolutions as advancing in the opposite direction, that is, from west to east; I refer to those of the sun, moon, and five planets. The sun thus regulates the year for us, and the moon the month, which are also very familiar periods of time. In like manner each of the other five planets completes its own orbit.\n'], ['subText', '\n\tYet [these motions] differ in many ways [from the daily rotation or first\nmotion]. In the first place, they do not swing around the same poles as the first\nmotion, but run obliquely through the zodiac. Secondly, these bodies are not\nseen moving uniformly in their orbits, since the sun and moon are observed to\nbe sometimes slow, at other times faster in their course. Moreover, we see the\nother five planets also retrograde at times, and stationary at either end [of the\nregression]. And whereas the sun always advances along its own direct path,\nthey wander in various ways, straying sometimes to the south and sometimes to\nthe north; that is why they are called "planets" [wanderers]. Furthermore, they\nare at times nearer to the earth, when they are said to be in <b>perigee</b>; at other\ntimes they are farther away, when they are said to be in <b>apogee</b>.\n'], ['subText', '\n\tNevertheless, despite these irregularities, we must conclude that the motions of these bodies are ever circular or compounded of circles, because these non-uniformities recur regularly according to a constant law. This could not happen unless the motions were circular, since only the circle can bring back the past.\n'], ['subText', "\n\tA simple heavenly body cannot be moved by a single sphere nonuniformly. For this nonuniformity would have to be caused either by an inconstancy in the moving force or by an alteration in the revolving body. It is improper to conceive any such defect in objects constituted in the best order. It stands to reason, therefore, that their uniform motions appear nonuniform to us. The cause may be either that their circles have poles different [from the earth's] or that the earth is not at the center of the circles on which they revolve.\n"], ['subText', "\n\tTo us who\nwatch the course of these planets from the earth, it happens that our eye does\nnot keep the same distance from every part of their orbits, but on account of\ntheir varying distances these bodies seem larger when nearer than when farther\naway (as has been proved in optics). Likewise, in equal arcs of their orbits their\nmotions will appear unequal in equal times on account of the observer's varying\ndistance.\n"], ['pmain2', 'Does circular motion suit the earth? What is its position?:'], ['subText', '\n\tThere is general agreement among the authorities that the earth is at rest in the middle of the universe. They hold the contrary view to be inconceivable or downright silly. Nevertheless, if we examine the matter more carefully, we shall see that this problem has not yet been solved, and is therefore by no means to be disregarded.\n'], ['subText', "\n\tEvery observed change of place is caused by a motion of either the observed object or the observer or, it is caused by an unequal displacement of each. For when things move with equal speed in the same direction, the motion is not perceived between the observed object and the observer. Therefore, if any motion is ascribed to the earth, in all things outside it the same motion will appear, but in the opposite direction, as though they were moving past it. Such in particular is the daily rotation, since it seems to involve the entire universe except the earth and what is around it. However, if you grant that the heavens have no part in this motion but that the\n\tearth rotates from west to east, you will find that this is the actual situation concerning the apparent rising and setting of the sun, moon, stars and planets. Moreover since the heavens, which enclose and provide the\n\tsetting for everything, constitute the space common to all things, it is not at first blush clear why motion should not be attributed rather to the enclosed than to the enclosing, to the thing located in space rather than to the framework of space. This view was certainly that of Heraclides and Ecphantus the Pythogorean and Hicetas of Syracuse (according to Cicero); for they ascribed the setting of the stars to the\n\tearth's interposition, and their rising to its withdrawal.\n"], ['subText', "\n\tIf we assume its daily rotation, another and no less important question\nfollows concerning the earth's position. There has been virtually unanimous acceptance of the belief that the middle of the universe is the earth. Anyone who denies that the earth occupies the middle or center of\nthe universe may nevertheless assert that its distance [therefrom] is insignificant in comparison with [the distance of] the sphere of the fixed stars, but\nperceptible and noteworthy in relation to the spheres of the sun and the other\nplanets. He may deem this to be the reason why their motions appear\nnonuniform, as conforming to a center other than the center of the earth. The fact that the same planets are observed nearer to the earth and farther away necessarily proves that the center of the earth is not the center of their circles.\n"], ['pmain2', 'The immensity of the heavens compared to the size of the earth:'], ['subText', '\n\tA circle that bisects a sphere passes\n\tthrough its center, and is the greatest circle that can\n\tbe described on it.

Then A, E, and C are on a straight line through\nthe dioptra. This line is evidently a diameter of the ecliptic, since six visible\nsigns form a semicircle, and E, the [line's] center, is identical with the horizon's\ncenter.\n"], ['subText', '\n\tAgain, let the signs shift their position until the first point of the Goat\nrises at B. At that time the Crab will also be observed setting at D. BED will be\na straight line and a diameter of the ecliptic. But, as we have already seen, AEC\nalso is a diameter of the same circle. Its center, obviously, is the intersection [of\nthe diameters]. A horizon, then, in this way always bisects the ecliptic, which is\na great circle of the sphere, and its center is clearly identical with the center of the ecliptic.\n'], ['subText', "\n\tYet a line drawn from the earth's surface [to a point in the firmament] must be distinct from the line drawn from the earth's center [to the same point]. Nevertheless, because these lines are immense in relation to the earth, they become like parallel lines. For in comparison with their length the space enclosed by them becomes imperceptible.\n"], ['subText', '\n\tThis reasoning certainly makes it quite\nclear that the heavens are immense by comparison with the Earth. On the testimony of the senses, the\nearth is related to the heavens as a point to a body, and a finite to an infinite\nmagnitude. It does not follow that the Earth must be at rest at the centre of the Universe. Indeed, a rotation in twenty-four hours of the enormously vast universe should astonish us even more than a rotation of its least part, which is the earth.\n'], ['subText', '\n\tThe argument that the center is motionless, and what is nearest the center moves the least, does not prove that the earth is at rest in the middle of the universe. Suppose you say that the heavens rotate but the poles are stationary, and what is closest to the poles moves the least. The Little Bear, for example, being very close to the pole, is observed to move much more slowly than the Eagle or the Little Dog because it describes a smaller circle. Yet all these constellations belong to a single sphere. These\n\tare brought round in equal times, though not over equal spaces, by the rotation\tof the whole sphere. The upshot of the argument, then, is the claim that the earth as a part of the celestial sphere shares in the same nature and movement so that, being close to the center, it has a slight motion. Therefore, being a body and not the center, it too will describe arcs like those of a celestial circle, though smaller, in the same time. The falsity of this contention is clearer than daylight. For it would always have to be noon in one place, and always midnight in another, so that the daily risings and settings could not take place, since the motion of the whole and the part would be one and inseparable.\n'], ['subText', "\nThings separated by the diversity of their situations are subject to a very\ndifferent relation: those enclosed in a smaller orbit revolve faster than those\ntraversing a bigger circle. Thus Saturn, the highest of the planets, revolves in\nthirty years; the moon, undoubtedly the nearest to the earth, completes its course\nin a month; and to close the series, it will be thought, the earth rotates in the\nperiod of a day and a night. Accordingly the same question about the daily\nrotation emerges again. On the other hand, likewise still undetermined is the\nearth's position, which has been made even less certain by what was said above.\nFor that proof establishes no conclusion other than the heavens' unlimited size\nin relation to the earth. \n"], ['pmain2', 'Why the ancients thought that the earth remained at rest in the universe as its center:'], ['subText', '\n\tAs their main reason, they adduce heaviness and lightness. Earth is in fact the\nheaviest element, and everything that has weight is borne toward it in an effort\nto reach its inmost center. The earth being spherical, by their own nature heavy objects are carried to it from all directions at right angles to its surface. Hence,\nif they were not checked at its surface, they would collide at its center. But things brought to the middle, it seems to follow, come to rest at the middle. All the more, then, will the entire earth be at rest in\nthe middle, and as the recipient of every falling body it will remain motionless\nthanks to its weight.\n'], ['subText', '\n\tAccording to Aristotle, the\nmotion of a single simple body is simple; of the simple motions, one is straight\nand the other is circular; of the straight motions, one is upward and the other is\ndownward. Hence every simple motion is either toward the middle, that is,\ndownward; or away from the middle, that is, upward; or around the middle,\nthat is, circular. To be carried downward, that is, to seek the middle, is a property only of earth and water, which are considered heavy; on the other hand, air\nand fire, which are endowed with lightness, move upward and away from the\nmiddle. To these four elements it seems reasonable to assign rectilinear motion,\nbut to the heavenly bodies, circular motion around the middle.\n'], ['subText', 'Therefore, remarks Ptolemy of Alexandria, if the earth were\n\tto move, merely in a daily rotation, a motion would have to be exceedingly violent and its\n\tspeed unsurpassable to carry the entire circumference of the earth around in\n\ttwenty-four hours. But things which undergo an abrupt rotation seem utterly\n\tunsuited to gather [bodies to themselves], and seem more likely, if they have\n\tbeen produced by combination, to fly apart unless they are held together by\n\tsome bond. The earth would long ago have burst asunder, he says, and dropped\n\tout of the skies (a quite preposterous notion);\n\tand, what is more, living creatures and any other loose weights would by no\tmeans remain unshaken. Nor would objects falling in a straight line descend perpendicularly to their appointed place, which would meantime have been\n\twithdrawn by so rapid a movement. Moreover, clouds and anything else floating in the air would be seen drifting always westward.\n'], ['pmain2', 'The inadequacy of the previous arguments and a refutation of them:'], ['subText', "\n\tFor these and similar reasons forsooth the ancients insist that the earth remains at rest in the middle of the universe, and that this is its status beyond any doubt. Yet if anyone believes that the earth rotates, surely he will hold that its motion is natural, not violent; what is in accordance with nature produces effects contrary to those resulting from violence, since things to which force or violence is applied must disintegrate and cannot long endure. On the other hand, that which is brought into existence by nature is well-ordered and preserved in its best state. Ptolemy has no cause, then, to fear that the earth and everything earthly will be disrupted by a rotation created through nature's handiwork, which is quite different from what art or human intelligence can accomplish.\n"], ['subText', '\n\tWhy does he not feel this apprehension even more for the universe, whose motion must be the swifter, the bigger the heavens are than the earth? Have the Heavens become so vast because of the centrifugal force of their violent motion, and would they collapse if they stood still? Were this reasoning sound, surely the size of the heavens would likewise grow to infinity. For the higher they are driven by the power of their motion, the faster that motion will be, since the circumference of which it must make the circuit in the period of twenty-four hours is constantly expanding; and, in turn, as the velocity of the motion mounts, the vastness of the heavens is enlarged. In this way the speed will increase the size, and the size the speed, to infinity. Yet according to the familiar axiom of physics that the infinite cannot be traversed or moved in any way, the heavens will therefore necessarily remain stationary.\n'], ['subText', '\n\tBeyond the heavens there is said to be no body, no space, no void, absolutely nothing, so that there is nowhere the heavens can go. In that case it is really astonishing if something can be held in check by nothing. We regard it as a certainty that the earth, enclosed between poles, is bounded by a spherical surface. Why then do we still hesitate to grant it the motion appropriate by nature to its form rather than attribute a movement to the entire universe, whose limit is unknown and unknowable? Why should we not admit, with regard to the daily rotation, that the appearance is in the heavens and the reality in the earth? For when a ship is floating calmly along all external things seem to have the motion that is really that of the ship, while those within the ship feel that they and all its contents are at rest. The motion of the earth can unquestionably produce the impression that the entire universe is rotating.\n'], ['subText', '\n\tWhat about the clouds and the other things that hang in the air in any manner whatsoever, or the bodies that fall down, and conversely those that rise aloft? We would only say that not merely the earth and the watery element joined with it have this motion, but also no small part of the air and whatever is linked in the same way to the earth. The reason may be either that the nearby air, mingling with earthy or watery matter, conforms to the same nature as the earth, or that the air\'s motion, acquired from the earth by proximity, shares without resistance in its unceasing rotation. No less astonishingly, on the other\n\thand, is the celestial movement declared to be accompanied by the uppermost\n\tbelt of air. This is indicated by those bodies that appear suddenly, I mean, those\n\tthat the Greeks called "comets" and "bearded stars." Like the other heavenly\n\tbodies, they rise and set. They are thought to be generated in that region. That\n\tpart of the air, we can maintain, is unaffected by the earth\'s motion on account\n\tof its great distance from the earth. The air closest to the earth will accordingly seem to be still. And so will the things suspended in it, unless they are tossed to and fro, as indeed they are. For what else is the wind in the air but the wave in the sea?\n'], ['subText', '\n\tAs a quality, moreover, immobility is deemed nobler and more divine than change and instability, which are therefore better suited to the earth than to the universe.\n'], ['subText', 'Last of all, the planets obviously approach closer to the earth and recede farther\n\tfrom it. Then the motion of a single body around the middle, which is thought\n\tto be the center of the earth, will be both away from the middle and also toward\n\tit. Motion around the middle, consequently, must be interpreted in a more\n\tgeneral way, the sufficient condition being that each such motion encircle its\n\town center. You see, then, that all these arguments make it more likely that the\n\tearth moves than that it is at rest.\n'], ['pmain2', 'Can several motions be attributed to the earth? The center of the universe:'], ['subText', "\n\tSince nothing prevents the earth from moving, I suggest that we should now consider also whether several motions suit it, so that it can be regarded as one of the planets. For, it is not the center of all the revolutions. This is indicated by the planet's apparent nonuniform motion and their varying distances from the earth. These phenomena cannot be explained by circles concentric with the earth. Therefore, since there are many centers, it will not be\n\tby accident that the further question arises whether the center of the universe\n\tis identical with the center of terrestrial gravity or with some other point. If, the earth too moves in other ways, for example, about a center, its additional motions must likewise be reflected in many bodies outside it.\n"], ['subText', '\n\tAmong these motions we find the yearly revolution. For if this is transformed from a solar to a terrestrial movement, with the sun acknowledged to be at rest, the risings and settings which bring the zodiacal signs and fixed stars into view morning and evening will appear in the same way. The stations of the planets, moreover, as well as their retrogradations and [resumptions of ] forward motion will be recognized as being, not movements of the planets, but a motion of the earth, which the planets borrow for their own appearances. Lastly, it will be realized that the sun occupies the middle of the universe. All these facts are disclosed to us by the principle governing the order in which the planets follow one another, and by the harmony of the entire universe, if only we look at the matter, as the saying goes, with both eyes. If, therefore, the Earth also has other motions, for example, about a center, these must necessarily resemble the many outside motions having a yearly period. If we take the Sun to be at rest, then morning and evening settings of Stars will be unaffected, while the stationary points, retrogressions, and progressions of the Planets are due not to their own proper motions, but to that of the Earth, which they reflect.\n'], ['pmain2', 'The order of the heavenly spheres:'], ['subText', '\n\tOf all things visible, the highest is the heaven of the fixed stars. But the ancient philosophers wanted to arrange the planets in accordance with the duration of the revolutions. Their principle assumes that of objects moving equally fast, those farther away seem to travel more slowly. The moon revolves in the shortest period of time because, in their opinion, it runs on the smallest circle as the nearest to the earth. The highest planet, on the other hand, is Saturn, which completes the biggest circuit in the longest time. Below it is Jupiter, followed by Mars.\n'], ['subText', '\n\tWith regard to Venus and Mercury, however, differences of opinion are found. Venus and Mercury are located above the sun by some authorities, like Plato in his Timaeus, but below the sun by others, like Ptolemy and many of the moderns. Al-Bitruji places Venus above the sun, and Mercury below it.\n'], ['subText', "\n\tAccording to Plato's followers, all the planets, being dark bodies otherwise,\nshine because they receive sunlight. If they were below the sun, the light which they receive would be\nreflected mostly upward, that is, toward the sun, as we see in the new or dying\nmoon. In addition, they argue, the sun must sometimes be eclipsed by the interposition of these planets, and its light cut off in proportion to their size. Since\nthis is never observed, these planets do not pass beneath the sun at all.\n"], ['subText', "\n\tThose who locate Venus and Mercury below the sun base their reasoning on the wide space which they notice between the sun and the moon. For the moon's greatest distance from the earth is 64 1/6 earth-radii. This is contained, according to them, about 18 times in the sun's least distance from the\n\tearth, which is 1160 earth-radii. Therefore between the sun and the moon there\n\tare 1096 earth-radii. Consequently, to avoid having so vast a space remain empty,\n\tthey announce that the same numbers almost exactly fill up the apsidal distances, by which they compute the thickness of those spheres. Thus the moon's\n\tapogee is followed by Mercury's perigee. Mercury's apogee is succeeded by the\n\tperigee of Venus, whose apogee, finally, almost reaches the sun's perigee. For\n\tbetween the apsides of Mercury they calculate about 177 1/2 earth-radii. Then\n\tthe remaining space is very nearly filled by Venus' interval of 910 earth-radii.\n"], ['subText', "\n\tTherefore, they do not admit that these heavenly bodies have any opacity like the moon's. On the contrary, these shine either with their own light or with the sunlight absorbed throughout their bodies. Moreover, they do not eclipse the sun, because it rarely happens that they interfere with our view of the sun, since they generally deviate in latitude. Besides, they are tiny bodies in comparison with the sun. Yet in his Paraphrase of Ptolemy, Ibn Rushd reports having seen something blackish when he found a conjunction of the sun and Mercury indicated in the tables. And thus these two planets\n\tare judged to be moving below the sun's sphere.\n"], ['subText', '\n\tNow there are those who locate Venus and then Mercury below the sun, or\nseparate these planets [from the sun] in some other sequence. What reason will\nthey adduce to explain why Venus and Mercury do not likewise traverse separate orbits divergent from the sun, like the other planets, without violating the arrangement [of the planets] in accordance with their [relative] swiftness and slowness? Then one of two alternatives will have to be true. Either the earth is not the\ncenter to which the order of the planets and spheres is referred, or there really is\nno principle of arrangement nor any apparent reason why the highest place\nbelongs to Saturn rather than to Jupiter or any other planet.\n'], ['subText', "\n\tTherefore, we should not in the least disregard what was familiar to Martianus Capella, the author of an encyclopedia, and to certain\nother Latin writers. For according to them, Venus and Mercury revolve around\nthe sun as their center. This is the reason, in their opinion, why these planets\ndiverge no farther from the sun than is permitted by the curvature of their\nrevolutions.

The equator and Earth's axis are variably inclined to this circle, which passes through the middle of the Zodiac, since if they were fixed and followed simply the motion of the Earth's centre there would be no inequality of days and nights.\n"], ['subText', "\n\tThe third motion in inclination is consequently required. This also is a yearly revolution, but it occurs in the reverse order of the signs, that is, in the direction opposite to that of the motion of the center. These two motions are opposite in direction and nearly equal in period. Let us describe a circle ABCD, which the annual revolution of the earth's center has traced in the plane of the ecliptic. Near its center let the sun be E. Let A represent the first point of the Crab, B of the Balance, C of\n\tthe Goat, and D of the Ram.\n"], ['figure', ['abcd1.PNG', 'This image is my own, and so are all images after this.']], ['subText', "\n\tNow let us assume that the earth's center is originally at A.

Under the conditions thus set\n\tforth, the earth's inhabitants will see the sun near the center E undergo the\n\twinter solstice in the Goat. This occurs because the greatest\n\tnorthward inclination, H, is turned toward the sun. For, the inclination of the\tequator to the line AE, through the agency of the daily rotation, traces the\n\twinter solstice parallel to the equator at an interval subtended by EAH, the angle of the obliquity.
